I hold a master’s degree in Physics from the University of Birmingham
and I'm currently working as a freelance consultant programmer/technical
architect in the UK commodity-trading sector, where I have been
fortunate enough to implement several large scale solutions in F#.

In my spare time I enjoy learning about new technologies/languages 
especially ones related programming and contributes to
several F# community open source projects. Including but not limited to

* [FAKE](http://github.com/fsharp/Fake)
* [FSharp.Data](http://github.com/fsharp/FSharp.Data)
